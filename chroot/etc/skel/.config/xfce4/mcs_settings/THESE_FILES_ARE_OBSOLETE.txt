The following files in this directory have been migrated to the new
Xfconf configuration system and can be safely deleted if you so desire:

    desktop.xml
    gtk.xml
    keyboard.xml
    mouse.xml
    workspaces.xml
    xfprint.xml
    xfwm4.xml
    xfwm4_keys.xml

them may need to be reconfigured manually.
